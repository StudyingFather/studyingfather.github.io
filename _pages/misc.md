## Amateur Radio

I obtained my amateur radio operation licence from [CRAC](http://www.crac.org.cn) in 2024. Now I have a callsign `BI1TUD`. View [qrz.com](https://www.qrz.com/db/BI1TUD) for more information.

## Competitive Programming

I used to be an active participant in competitive programming (CP). I have won multiple prizes in CP competitions, including [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://icpc.global) (ICPC), [China Collegiate Programming Contest](https://ccpc.io) (CCPC), [National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces](https://noi.cn) (NOIP).

You can find me on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/StudyingFather), [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/StudyingFather).

Also, I'm deeply involved in CP community building. I have made contributions to multiple CP communities, including [Luogu Online Judge](https://www.luogu.com.cn) and [OI Wiki](https://oi-wiki.org).
