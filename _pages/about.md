Hello, I'm Shuhao Zhang, a first-year PhD student from [Programming Language Lab](https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Yingfei Xiong](https://xiongyingfei.github.io/). I received my Bachelor's degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).

My research interests focus on programming languages, especially on program verification and program synthesis.

I have been involved in competitive programming for a long time. See [Misc](/misc) for more detailed information.
